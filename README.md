## About Me
Hello! 👋 I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in **audio processing and generation**. My research interests include:

- **Diffusion Models**: Exploring generative capabilities in audio and beyond.
- **Audio Generation**: Creating realistic and expressive audio content.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Synthesizing natural-sounding speech from text inputs.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Developing robust transcription models.
- **Speech-to-Speech (S2S)**: Enhancing real-time voice conversion and transformation.

<br/>
<br/>


## Current Focus
🔍 **Investigating diffusion-based approaches** for audio generation and exploring novel architectures for improved fidelity and realism.

🎵 **Developing TTS and STT models** that are efficient, scalable, and capable of handling low-resource languages.
